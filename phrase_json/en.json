  "ASF_SB_1": "# asf_search Basics\n\n## Overview\n\nasf_search is a Python package for performing searches of the ASF catalog. In addition, it offers baseline functionality and download support. It is available through PyPi and Conda.\n\n\timport asf_search as asf\n\n\tresults = asf.granule_search(['ALPSRS279162400', 'ALPSRS279162200'])\n\tprint(results)\n\n\twkt = 'POLYGON((-135.7 58.2,-136.6 58.1,-135.8 56.9,-134.6 56.1,-134.9 58.0,-135.7 58.2))'\n\tresults = asf.geo_search(platform=[asf.PLATFORM.SENTINEL1], intersectsWith=wkt, maxResults=10)\n\tprint(results)\n\nFor an introductory walkthrough of asf_search, see the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-asf_search/tree/master/examples).\n\n## Installation\nIn order to easily manage dependencies, we recommend using dedicated project environments via [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n\nasf_search can be installed into a conda environment with\n\n\tconda install -c conda-forge asf_search\n\nor into a virtual environment with\n\n\tpython -m pip install asf_search\n\n## Usage\nProgrammatically searching for ASF data is made simple with asf_search. Several search functions are provided. Each search function returns an ```ASFSearchResults``` object:\n\n- ```geo_search()``` Find product info over an area of interest using a WKT string\n- ```granule_search()``` Find product info using a list of scene names\n- ```product_search()``` Find product info using a list of product IDs\n- ```stack_from_id()``` Find a baseline stack of products using a reference scene\n- If the above search approaches do not meet your search needs, ```search()``` supports all available keywords:\n\t- ```search()``` Find product info using any combination of search parameters\n- Additionally, numerous constants are provided to ease the search process. Currently, we provide constants for beam mode, flight direction, instrument, platform, polarization, and product type. You can see the full [list of constants here](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-asf_search/tree/master/asf_search/constants).\n\nAdditionally, asf_search supports downloading data, both from search results as provided by the above search functions, and directly on product URLs. An authenticated session is generally required. More information on available authentication methods can be found [here](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/authentication/). You may also authenticate using an ```ASFSession``` object and one of the following authentication methods. ```ASFSession``` is a subclass of ```Session```.\n\n- ```auth_with_creds('user', 'pass)```\n- ```auth_with_token('EDL token')```\n- ```auth_with_cookiejar(http.cookiejar)```\n\nIf not using .netrc credentials, that session should be passed to whichever download method is being called, can be re-used, and is thread safe.\n\nExample using .netrc:\n\n\tresults = ....\n\tresults.download(path='....')\n\nExample with manual authentication:\n\n\tresults = asf_search.granule_search([...])\n\tsession = asf_search.ASFSession().auth_with_creds('user', 'pass')\n\tresults.download(path='/Users/SARGuru/data', session=session)\n\nAlternately, asf_search supports downloading an arbitrary list of URLs. All of the available authentication methods are supported:\n\n\turls = [...]\n\tasf_search.download_urls(urls=urls, path='/Users/SARGuru/data', session=ASFSession().auth_with_token('EDL token'))\n\nAlso note that ```ASFSearchResults.download()``` and the generic ```download_urls()``` function both accept a ```processes``` parameter which allows for parallel downloads.\n\nFurther examples of all of the above can be found in this [sample script](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-asf_search/blob/master/examples/hello_world.py).",

  "ASFSOPS_1": "# ASFSearchOptions\n\n## Description\n\nThis class describes a set of search parameters. While it is not required to use this class when constructing a search, it can be useful, as it provides some degree of immediate parameter validation, as well as a convenient way to manipulate and handle search options in general.\n\nSpecific search parameters are handled as object attributes. Attempting to add an attribute that is not supported will raise a KeyError. Attempting to delete an attribute will result in it being set to None. Search parameters can be set via kwargs at object instantion, or directly on an existing object using the normal mechanisms.\n\nConverting to a `dict` will only include search options which have actually been set to a usable value. That is, any options set to `None` will be ignored.\n\n***\n\n## Attributes\n- maxResults\n- absoluteBurstID\n- absoluteOrbit\n- asfFrame\n- beamMode\n- provider\n- collectionName\n- maxDoppler\n- minDoppler\n- maxFaradayRotation\n- minFaradayRotation\n- flightDirection\n- flightLine\n- fullBurstID\n- frame\n- granule_list\n- product_list\n- intersectsWith\n- lookDirection\n- offNadirAngle\n- operaBurstID\n- platform\n- polarization\n- processingLevel\n- relativeBurstID\n- relativeOrbit\n- processingDate\n- start\n- end\n- season\n- groupID\n- insarStackId\n- instrument\n- session\n\n***\n\n## Methods\n\n_ASFSearchOptions does not provide any methods intended for direct use, instead relying on a handful of dunders for the desired behavior.

  "BASELINE_1": "#Baseline Search Type\n\n## What is Baseline?\nBaseline uses information from two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the same target area acquired at different times (temporal baseline) and from slightly different satellite orbit positions (perpendicular baseline). The Vertex baseline tool helps you identify and select scene pairs that are appropriate for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing. It provides visualization of perpendicular and temporal baseline data, and allows you to easily change the reference scene used in any stack.\n\n## How to use Vertex Baseline Tool\nVisit **[ASF's Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu)** to begin using the Baseline tool.\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp5bgvi2pEM)\n\n### **Beginning your Baseline Search**\n\n- If you do not have a particular reference scene chosen, you can search for scenes using the geographic or list search. The center column will have a button under the metadata titled ***Baseline Tool*** for any scenes that are eligible. You may click this button to be directed to a Baseline search. The Baseline search will use the chosen scene as the reference scene.\n\n- If you do have a particular reference scene chosen, you can select ***Baseline*** from the Search Type dropdown list. You may enter your reference scene and hit ***Search***.\n\n### **Interacting with Baseline Search Results**\nWhile in Baseline Search type, you will notice many familiar controls in the results panel. The scenes are shown in the left column. The perpendicular and temporal baselines are listed next to each scene. The center column lists the metadata for the selected scene, and includes the **Set as Reference** button, which allows you to set any scene in the stack as the reference scene. The Baseline Chart is shown in the right column.\n\n**Result Panel Controls**\n\n- At the top left of the results panel, you will see the number of scenes listed.\n- **Zoom** will *Zoom to results* magnifying the map area of the Earth where the scenes are located.\n- **Queue** will *Add all results to Downloads* allowing you to add all scenes to the download queue.\n- **On Demand** will allow you to *Add all results to On Demand queue* to do custom processing on the scenes. To learn more click [here](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/vertex/). You may also choose to *Create Subscription*. More details about subscriptions can be found [here](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/subscriptions/).\n- **Export** will allow you to *Download data/metadata* for all scenes in the stack.\n- In the left column, **Queue** will *Add scene files to downloads* for the selected scene only.\n- Under the metadata in the center column, **Set as Reference** will allow you to set any scene in the stack as the reference scene. When you select this, both the chart and the baseline values will be updated automatically.\n\n**Chart Controls**\n\n- The dots on the chart represent individual scenes. Hovering over them will list their temporal and perpendicular values. You may also click on any point to select that scene. The metadata in the center column will be updated.\n- Located above the chart, there are labels and corresponding colors. These indicate how the reference scene, selected scene, and any scenes in your download queue are displayed on the chart. Some datasets include a shaded area which indicates the critical baseline.\n- You may zoom and pan the chart.\n\n#### Baseline Criteria\n\n- You may click **Baseline Criteria...** above the chart for additional options.\n\t- You can adjust the sliders to change the perpendicular and temporal values that you wish to be included in your results.\n\t- You can enter a start and end date.\n\t- Changing any criteria will automatically update the list of scenes and the chart.\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce you are satisfied with your result set, you can use the download queue to manage and download baseline results. More information about the download queue can be found in the [Vertex Getting Started User Guide](/vertex/manual).\n\nIf you wish to create interferograms, custom processing is now available through Vertex. Details are available in the On Demand Queue section of the [Vertex Getting Started User Guide](/vertex/manual). You can find more information about creating interferograms with ASF's custom processing through the [HyP3 documentation](https://hyp3.asf.alaska.edu/about).\n",

  "COOKBOOK_1": "# Search API Tips & Tricks\n\nThis is a collection of some tips & tricks for the Search API!\n\n## New Python package for performing searches\nasf_search is a Python package for performing searches of the ASF catalog. In addition, it offers baseline functionality and download support. It is available through PyPi and Conda. More information can be found [here](/asf_search/basics).\n\n## Rate Limitation on Search Endpoint\nThere has been a rate limitation instituted on the [search endpoint](/api/keywords/#search-endpoint). The rate limitation is per IP and is currently 250 queries per minute. Upon hitting the limit, further queries will yield a HTTP 429 with an error message. Check to see if your queries are returning a small number of results. If so, you can refine your parameters to combine result sets into larger groups and then post-process those results locally. For instance, instead of searching on a small area of interest with an individual query for each day, select a larger date range in order to create a single query, then split the results apart after they have been retrieved.\n\n## Vertex Copy/Paste Search API URL\nHave you have completed a geo search in Vertex, that you'd like to replicate in a Search API query? Click the Down Arrow under the Max Results. Choose \"API URL...\".\n\nHere you can see the Search API URL you would use to replicate the search. You may change the maxResults and output format. Once you are satisfied, click the copy icon. Now you can paste the query into a browser or command line interface to execute it.\n\n## Find the Product_List Value in Vertex\nThe product/file name is listed in Vertex Search Results, under the Files detail column. You can click the Copy icon to copy the File ID. You can also copy all File IDs from your Download Queue in Vertex. Once you have your desired list of files, you can find them via the Search API using the product_list keyword.\n\n## Search Results Can Become Search Area\nYou can turn your search results into a search area. First, export your search results as GeoJSON or KML output format. Next, import your file into Vertex geo search. Vertex will extract the AOI from your file. If desired, you can add filters and can save your search filters or the search itself.\n\n## Verify Your Query is Returning the Correct Number of Results\nWould you like to verify that your query has returned the correct number of results? Change your output to \"output=count\" to verify. If the count does not match, consider narrowing your search by using more keywords, or by using keyword “maxResults” to limit it. You may also try shortening the date range to split your search into a series of smaller searches.",
  "DERIVED_DATASETS_1": "# Derived Datasets Search Type\n\n## What are Derived Datasets?\n\nDerived datasets are higher-level datasets created using SAR data. The datasets listed below are ASF's collection.\n\n### Global Seasonal Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence & Backscatter Dataset\n\nThis dataset is the first-of-its-kind spatial representation of multi-seasonal, global SAR repeat-pass interferometric coherence and backscatter signatures. Global coverage comprises all land masses and ice sheets from 82 degrees northern to 78 degrees southern latitude. The dataset is derived from high-resolution multi-temporal repeat-pass interferometric processing of about 205,000 Sentinel-1 Single-Look-Complex (SLC) data acquired in Interferometric Wide-Swath mode (Sentinel-1 IW mode) from 1-Dec-2019 to 30-Nov-2020. Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/datasets/derived/global-seasonal-sentinel-1-interferometric-coherence-and-backscatter-dataset/).\n\n### Global Ice Sheet Mapping Observatory (GISMO)\n\nThe Global Ice-Sheet Mapping Observatory (GISMO) spaceborne radar system is part of the NASA Instrument Incubator Project (IIP). GISMO has a specific focus in measuring the surface topography of ice sheets, ice-sheet thickness, and in uncovering physical properties of the glacier bed using SAR. It utilized VHF and P-band interferometric radars and tested different methods of clutter rejection. GISMO achieved mapping the physical properties of a glacier bed through up to 5 km of ice. The GISMO project documented flight lines over the Greenland ice sheet in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/derived-data-sets/global-ice-sheet-mapping-orbiter-gismo/).\n\n### Glacier Speed\n\nThis dataset was produced by Evan Burgess and colleagues at the University of Utah and the University of Alaska Fairbanks using ALOS PALSAR data. It reveals complex patterns of glacier flow throughout Alaska. The speed data are available for download in formats designed both for scientists and educators. Surface velocities are available for 47,880 km^2 of glacier ice, which includes almost all of the state’s major glaciers. Detailed information on its production is available in [Burgess et al., Nature Communications, 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3146). Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/derived-data-sets/glacier-speed/).\n\n### International Polar Year\n\nInternational Polar Year (IPY) is a collaborative research event focused on the Arctic and Antarctic. IPY 2007-2009 focused on collaborative research and extensively explored the complex relationships between the Arctic and Antarctic. Over 60 countries and thousands of researchers participated, investigating more than 200 projects. Topics include Arctic and Antarctic relationships with geophysical elements, oceans and sea ice, Earth’s atmosphere, space, and human relations. ASF hosts an archive of the IPY project titled the Global Inter-agency IPY Polar Snapshot Year (GIIPSY). GIIPSY’s objective was to obtain high-definition satellite snapshots of the polar regions during 2007-2008. Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/sar-data-sets/international-polar-year-2007-2008/).\n\n\n### Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP)\n\nThe RADARSAT-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) is composed of two main missions, the first Antarctic Mapping Mission (AMM-1) and the Modified Antarctic Mapping Mission (MAMM). AMM-1 started on September 9, 1997 and was completed on October 20, 1997. Its goals were to acquire a complete map of Antarctica and better understand the relationships between the southernmost continent’s environmental elements. MAMM started on September 3, 2000 and was completed on November 17, 2000. It planned to remap Antarctica and measure ice velocity data using interferometric analysis and data from AMM-1. Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/derived-data-sets/radarsat-antarctic-mapping-project-ramp/).\n\n\n### Sea Ice MEaSUREs\n\nSea-ice imagery and data products are supported under NASA’s Making Earth System data records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program. Arctic and Southern Ocean imagery, data, and data products are available at no cost to approved users from the ASF DAAC. These include over 11 years of RADARSAT-1 three-day radar snapshots of Arctic and Southern Ocean sea ice, and original SAR images. RADARSAT-1 data have been processed to construct a near decadal record of small-scale ice motion of the Arctic and Southern Oceans, a record of ice motion of the northern Bering Sea, and monthly high-resolution image mosaics of the Arctic Ocean. Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/derived-data-sets/sea-ice-measures/).\n\n### Wetlands MEaSUREs\n\nThe inundated wetlands Earth System Data Record (ESDR) consists of two primary components. First, fine-resolution maps of wetland extent, vegetation type, and seasonal inundation dynamics, derived from SAR for regional and continental-scale areas covering crucial wetlands systems. Second, global coarse-resolution time series mappings of inundated area fraction at ~25 km resolution derived from multiple satellite remote sensing observations including passive and active microwave sensors and optical data sets optimized for inundation detection. These datasets are provided on a bi-monthly basis for 1992-1999 and daily for 2000 onward. Annual summary products and a daily near real time (NRT) dataset with 2-3 day latency are also provided. Further information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/data-sets/derived-data-sets/wetlands-measures/).\n",

Sentinel-1A was launched in 2014, and Sentinel-1B was launched in 2016. Each satellite has a 12 day repeat cycle, and some areas have coverage every 6 days. New acquisition data is available to download within 3 days, though it is most often available within 24 hours. The data is free and easy to download in several formats.\n\n*Note*: As of December 23, 2021, the Sentinel-1B mission has ended due to an anomaly. This affects the coverage cycle in some areas. More information can be found [here](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/-/end-of-mission-of-the-copernicus-sentinel-1b-satellite/1.5).\n\n#### RAW\nRAW products require calibration & processing steps before the data is analysis-ready. These products are best suited for use by SAR specialists.\n\n#### GRD\nGround Range Detected (GRD) products are best for amplitude applications, such as generating RTC images. These are Level 1 products. These products are georeferenced, and multi-looked into a single image. Only amplitude information is included in the GRD.\n\n- No effort required to view data in a GIS software\n- Easy to project to desired coordinate system\n- Pixels are in ground-detected geometry\n- One consolidated image for each polarization\n- Square pixels\n- Smaller file size\n\n#### SLC\nSingle Look Complex (SLC) products are necessary for interferometry. These are Level 1 products. These products are comprised of 3 GeoTIFFs, one for each of the sub-swaths, and each radar burst is included in the data. The SLC includes phase data.\n\n- Remains in slant-range geometry\n- Phase data is retained\n\t- Suitable for detecting changes in surface elevation\n\t- Required for generating interferograms\n- Several images for each SLC\n- Retains each subswath (including overlap) and series of bursts, with a black line grid\n\n#### OCN\nOCN products are higher level products, generated from the Level 1 products. These products are focused on ocean applications, including waves & wind direction. \n\n### Sentinel-1 Bursts\nA Sentinel-1 SLC contains multiple measurement TIFFs that contain the radar response data. Each measurement TIFF can be further broken down into a single radar pulse response message which is referred to as a burst.\n\nThere are multiple parameters that allow searching for bursts across sub-swaths and burst cycles. Depictions of a single burst, and the three available burst-related IDs are below.\n\nSingle burst:  \n![Screenshot](/images/single_burst_diagram.png){: style=\"height:150px;width:150px\"}\n\nAbsolute Burst ID:  \n![Screenshot](/images/absolute_burst_id_diagram.png){: style=\"height:150px;width:150px\"}\n\nRelative Burst ID:  \n![Screenshot](/images/relative_burst_id_diagram.png){: style=\"height:150px;width:150px\"}\n\nFull Burst ID:  \n![Screenshot](/images/full_burst_id_diagram.png){: style=\"height:150px;width:150px\"}\n\nEach burst file also has a corresponding XML Metadata file available. The Burst XML Metadata is a virtually generated file, and therefore does not have its own unique filename. The XML Metadata can only be found via the burst scene name, and is not searchable in a list search.\n\n### OPERA Sentinel-1\nObservational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis [(OPERA)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/about-opera?_ga=2.199717550.185027135.1698074247-1558404154.1684781882) is a project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [(JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera?_ga=2.266246031.185027135.1698074247-1558404154.1684781882), created to address high-priority requests from the NASA [Satellite Needs Working Group](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/project/snwg.html?_ga=2.199717550.185027135.1698074247-1558404154.1684781882) and its partners for products generated from SAR and optical sensors.\n\nThe following OPERA products can be found through Vertex, asf_search, or the SearchAPI:\n \n- Near-global land surface Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) backscatter product\n- Near-global land surface Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) backscatter static layers product\n- North America Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) product\n- North America Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) static layers product\n\n“Near-global” corresponds to all landmasses excluding Antarctica. “North America” corresponds to the United States and U.S. Territories, Canada within 200 km of the U.S. border, and all mainland countries from the southern U.S. border up to and including Panama.\n\nThe near-global RTC products are available from 2023 to present. The North America CSLC products will be available from 2014 to present.\n\n####RTC\nThe Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) Backscatter product consists of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter data normalized with respect to the topography. It is a Level-2 product that is projected onto a pre-defined UTM/Polar stereographic map projection system. The Copernicus Global 30 m (GLO-30) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the reference DEM used to correct for the impacts of topography and to geocode the product. The product is provided in a GeoTIFF file format. The RTC metadata is in HDF5 format.\n\n####RTC Static\nThe RTC-STATIC product is a Level 2 product that contains static radar geometry layers associated with the RTC product.\n\n####CSLC\nThe Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) product consists of SLC images that are precisely aligned or “coregistered” to a pre-defined UTM/Polar stereographic map projection system. The CSLC images contain both the amplitude and phase information of the complex radar return. The Level-2 CSLC product is derived from Sentinel-1 data and is provided in HDF5 format.\n\n####CSLC Static \nThe CSLC-ST product serves as an ancillary product to the CSLC products and is distributed separately from the CSLC products. It is only produced once (or a limited amount of times) for CSLC products characterized by the same burst identification string i.e., for all the Sentinel-1-A/B bursts covering the same geographical area on the ground.\n\n### ALOS PALSAR\nALOS PALSAR offers historical data, and has some analysis-ready RTC (Radiometric Terrain Corrected) products, processed by ASF. \n\n#### RTC\nNote that a resampled DEM (SRTM or NED) was used for RTC processing. DEM information can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/information/palsar-rtc-dem-information/). These RTCs can be used to replace optical imagery in areas with frequent cloud cover. They may also be used to improve land cover classification. More advanced processing techniques include data fusion, either on a pixel level or on a feature level, using an object-oriented approach.\n\n- Projected to UTM coordinates\n- Hi-Res Terrain Corrected products are 12.5 meter resolution\n- Low-Res Terrain Corrected products are 30 meter resolution\n\nThe ALOS PALSAR Product Guide can be found [here](https://asf.alaska.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rtc_product_guide_v1.2.pdf).\n\n#### Level 2.2\nThese products are projected in a custom Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) datum. These products require reprojection to the appropriate UTM zone before they can be analyzed in a GIS software.\n\n#### Level 1.5\nThese products are in CEOS data format, and do not contain a spatial reference. These must be geocoded before any processing or analysis. Once geocoded, these may be exported as GeoTIFF files. This [data recipe](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-recipes/how-to-view-and-geocode-ceos-data-in-asf-mapready/) uses ASF’s MapReady software to view and geocode CEOS format files.\n\n### ALOS AVNIR-2\nALOS AVNIR-2 is an optical dataset that offers historical data. These products are ortho rectified images (ORI). Orthorectification is the process of removing image distortions caused by the sensor and terrain to create a planimetric image at every location with consistent scale across all parts of the image. This allows the overlay of various geospatial information with the ORI on any map. The products contain 4 bands, and each image has 30% cloud cover or less.\n\n### SIR-C\nSIR-C was flown on two missions, six months apart. The first mission dates were April 9-20, 1994 and the second mission dates were September 30-October 11, 1994. The second flight followed nearly the same orbit as the first flight. Therefore, there are repeat-pass products available, enabling interferometric SAR processing over these areas.\n\n### ARIA S1 GUNW\nThese products are already processed interferograms. You may download either the full netCDF product, or select GeoTIFF layers. These are analysis-ready InSAR products. These products do have a limited spatial coverage.\n\n### SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)\nSMAP was launched with both an active and a passive sensor to collect high-resolution soil moisture data globally. Unfortunately, the active SAR sensor malfunctioned a few months into the mission. The passive sensor is still ongoing. With only the passive sensor functional, the soil moisture data is in a coarse resolution. The coarse resolution products can still be used for regional analysis or larger-scale projects.\n\n- 2015 - Present\n\t- Active sensor data available for the first 3 months\n- L-band\n- Measures soil moisture and freeze-thaw state in top 5 cm of soil globally every three days (multi-kilometer resolution)\n\t- High resolution capabilities lost with loss of active sensor\n\t- Recent efforts to integrate Sentinel-1 data have generated higher-resolution products\n- Variety of soil moisture products available [here](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov)\n\n### UAVSAR\nUAVSAR offers airborne acquisitions of targeted locations. Because the acquisitions are targeted, there are generally not repeat passes over one area. However, if UAVSAR covers your area of interest, this dataset includes a variety of available products.\n\n- 2008 - present\n- Quad-pol L-band\n- Airborne, targeted locations, irregular timing\n- Flights can be requested for your area of interest\n- Pre-processed backscatter and interferometric products\n\t- PolSAR and Repeat-Pass Interferometry\n\n#### KMZ\nThese products are georeferenced products. These can be used in Google Earth, or other applications that support kmz format files. These products have a 6 meter pixel spacing.\n\n- **Beam Mode POL**: These contain a polarimetry single-pass product, using a quad-pol backscatter decomposition.\n\t- Red: HH; Green: HV; Blue: VV\n- **Beam Mode RPI**: These products are generated from two passes. In addition to the polarimetry product, these also include amplitude, correlation, interferometry, and digital elevation map products.\n\t- The amplitude product contains backscatter for each polarization\n\t- The correlation product is phase coherence between passes\n\t- The interferometry product shows landscape changes\n\t- The digital elevation map product is for reference\n\n### RADARSAT-1\nThese products are in CEOS data format, and do not contain a spatial reference. These must be geocoded before any processing or analysis, and once geocoded, may be exported as GeoTIFF files. RADARSAT-1 is restricted data, and requires a [research agreement](https://asf.alaska.edu/restricted-data-access-request/) to download.

These acquisitions cover primarily the United States, and some tropical locations. The campaign name listed for each product is its acquisition location. Because the acquisitions are targeted, there are generally not repeat passes over one area. However, if AIRSAR covers your area of interest, there are a variety of sensors and frequencies available. There are JPGs available, though they are not georeferenced.\n\n#### Beam Mode: POLSAR or 3FP\nIn POLSAR mode, fully polarimetric data are acquired at all three frequencies in P-, L-, C-band for 40 Mhz or 20 Mhz. The L-band also provides 80 MHz bandwidth data. POLSAR data are sensitive to the geometry (including vegetation) and dielectrical properties (water content) of the terrain.\n\n#### Beam Mode: TOPSAR or XTI\nIn TOPSAR mode, AIRSAR collects interferometric data using C- and L-band to produce digital elevation models (DEMs). The radars which are not being used for interferometry collect quad-pol data co-registered with the C-band DEM.  Interferometric data can be collected in \"ping-pong\" mode, where each antenna is used alternately for transmit and the effective baseline is doubled, and in \"common-transmitter\" mode where only one antenna is used for transmit.\n\n#### Beam Mode: ATI\nIn the along-track interferometry (ATI) mode, AIRSAR collects data C- and L-band. Data collected can be used to measure ocean current velocities. \n\n### Seasat\nSeasat was the first spaceborne SAR mission, launched in 1978. This data has been processed by ASF into digital imagery. These products may have substantial geolocation errors.\n\n#### HDF5\nThe backscatter values are contained in the HH layer. In order to provide basic geolocation information, two additional layers, latitude and longitude, are added. They contain geographic coordinates for every pixel in the image. The time variable completes the compliance to the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions.\n\n#### GeoTIFF\nThese products are geocoded to the UTM map projection, using the zone that best represents the data's geolocation. The original 12.5 meter pixel size and the floating-point values of the ground range HDF5 products are kept in the GeoTIFF format. This product type contains only a single layer, and is therefore considerably smaller than the HDF5 product.\n\n### Global Seasonal Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence & Backscatter Dataset\nThis dataset is the first-of-its-kind spatial representation of multi-seasonal, global SAR repeat-pass interferometric coherence and backscatter signatures. Global coverage comprises all land masses and ice sheets from 82 degrees northern to 78 degrees southern latitude. The dataset is derived from high-resolution multi-temporal repeat-pass interferometric processing of about 205,000 Sentinel-1 Single-Look-Complex (SLC) data acquired in Interferometric Wide-Swath (IW) mode from Dec 1, 2019 to Nov 30, 2020.\n\nThe dataset covers several seasonal metrics, listed below. The seasons consist of December, January, February (DJF); March, April, May (MAM); June, July, August (JJA); and September, October, November (SON).\n\n- Median 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 36-, and 48-day repeat coherence estimates for C-band VV and HH polarized data\n- Mean backscatter (γº) for VV, VH, HH, and HV polarizations\n- Seasonal coherence decay model parameters rho, tau, and rmse\n- Local incidence and layover/shadow regions for all relative Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B orbits. Note that in the dataset filenames seasons were referred to as northern hemisphere winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA), and fall (SON).\n\n#### Data Products\n- Coherence Tiles separated by latitude\n- Virtual Raster tables\n- Global mosaics separated into seasons\n\n### GISMO\nThe Global Ice-Sheet Mapping Observatory (GISMO) project had a specific focus in measuring the surface topography of ice sheets, ice-sheet thickness, and in uncovering physical properties of the glacier bed using SAR.\n\nThe GIMSO project had documented flight lines over the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2006, 2007, and 2008. It utilized VHF and P-band interferometric radars and tested different methods of clutter rejection in order to find the method most suitable for the project’s focus.\n\nGISMO achieved mapping the physical properties of a glacier bed through up to 5 km of ice. It also created an effective clutter rejection technique for measuring the ice sheet’s surface and base. GISMO has applications in predicting the effects of climate change on ice sheets and in exploring planets with icy areas.\n\n#### Data Products\n- 150 MHz Data Products: May 23, 2006\n- 450 MHz Data Products: Sept 10, 2007\n- 150 MHz Data Products: Sept 12, 2007\n- Low Aircraft Elevation Data Products: 2008\n- High Aircraft Elevation Data Products: 2008\n\nFor these products, each flight line was segmented into approximately 25 km long sections with 20% overlap on each end.\n\n### Glacier Speed\nGlacier Speed is the first near-comprehensive dataset of wintertime glacier-flow speeds throughout Alaska, and reveals complex patterns of glacier flow throughout the state. The findings significantly advance understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the rapid glacier mass loss occurring in Alaska. \n\nThe patterns include glacier surging and spatial variations in flow related to climate. Notably, the data show that out of tens of thousands of glaciers in Alaska, only 12 are responsible for the majority of downstream ice flux. These glaciers are flowing exceptionally fast because they receive very high rates of snowfall and are not necessarily flowing fast because of tidewater retreat. (The flow speed is not the same as the melt rate; melting is strong enough at low elevations that it is outpacing the high snowfall rates.)\n\nThe data have also revealed that iceberg calving in Alaska is an important component of the statewide glacier mass budget: The volume of calved ice is 17.1 km3 – or roughly equivalent to a third of the annual net glacier mass change in Alaska.\n\n#### Data Products\n- KMZ format statewide glacier-flow-speed map\n- ZIP file that includes readme file and a speed.tif, ids.tif, and .par file for each of the nine regions\n\nThe nine regions are: Central Alaska Range, Chugach Mountains, Coastal Range, Delta Range, Fairweather Range - Glacier Bay, Hayes Range, Kenai Mountains, Tordrillo Mountains, and Wrangell Mountains - St. Elias Mountains\n\nThe flow-speed data are gridded on 90-meter-resolution UTM grids as GeoTIFFs. The grids are divided into different regions and include a speed file that contains the mosaicked flow speed in meters/day (32-bit float) and a ids file that contains integer IDs that correspond to the image pair used for determining flow speed at each pixel (16-bit integer).\n\nThe dates of the image pairs used can be found by looking up image IDs in the corresponding .par file. In some cases, the .par file will contain IDs that are not in the ids grid. In these cases, these image pairs were simply not needed in the final mosaic. The .par file also includes georeference information in a text format.\n\n### International Polar Year\nASF hosts an archive of the International Polar Year (IPY) project titled the Global Inter-agency IPY Polar Snapshot Year (GIIPSY). GIIPSY’s objective was to obtain high-definition satellite snapshots of the polar regions during 2007-2008. The primary purpose is to use these snapshots as benchmarks for gauging past and future environmental changes in the polar ice, ocean, and land.\n\n#### Data Products\n- Greenland L0 Kongsberg\n- Greenland Level 0 (September 2000-January 2001)\n- Greenland Level 1 (September 2000-January 2001)\n- Antarctica Level 1 (September 2000-January 2001)\n- Toolik Station Level 1 (October 2004-December 2006)\n- Kamchatka Level 1 (December 1999-January 2000)\n- Sea Ice Snapshots (Min & Max Snapshots, September-March of 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007)  \n\n### RAMP\nThe RADARSAT-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) was composed of two main missions, the first Antarctic Mapping Mission (AMM-1) and the Modified Antarctic Mapping Mission (MAMM). Both missions utilized RADARSAT-1.\n\nAMM-1 started on September 9, 1997 and was completed on October 20, 1997. Its goals were to acquire a complete map of Antarctica and better understand the relationships between the southernmost continent’s environmental elements. Using the right- and left-looking abilities of RADARSAT-1, a mosaic map of Antarctica at 25 meter resolution was created. The map displayed Antarctica’s geological features through variations in radar brightness and texture, including ice streams. Ice velocity vectors were compiled using AMM-1 data to measure ice sheet movement over ice streams.\n\nMAMM began three years after AMM-1 ended, starting on September 3, 2000 and ending on November 17, 2000. It planned to remap Antarctica and measure ice velocity data using interferometric analysis and data from AMM-1. In the three years’ difference between the two main Antarctic Mapping Missions, ice sheet advance and retreat could be observed and better evaluated as episodic change or regional climate change.\n\n#### Data Products\n- 25 meter Final Tiles\n- 25 meter Tile Overviews\n- 16 bit 25 meter Tile Overviews of the backscatter coefficient in dB\n- 200 meter Final Coherence (ascending and descending)\n- 200 meter Coherence Overviews (ascending and descending)\n- A variety of mosaic products\n- AMM-1 & MAMM Coastline\n- AMM-1 & MAMM Control points\n- DEMs\n- East Antarctic\n- Velocity Product\n- Balance Velocity Map\n\n### Sea Ice MEaSUREs\nThe data and imagery available from ASF cover a period from 1995 to 2011. They include more than 11 years of near-uninterrupted, three-day radar snapshots of Arctic and Southern Ocean’s sea ice as it goes through dramatic change.\n\nUses include:\n\n- New approaches for modeling the mechanical behavior of sea ice and the validation of these models\n- Characterization of sub-daily ice motion \n- Description of the seasonal and regional variability of sea-ice deformation\n- Validation of ICESat freeboard algorithms\n- Estimates of sea-ice exchange between the Arctic and Southern Oceans and peripheral seas\n\n#### Data Products\n- A dataset of small-scale kinematics and deformation processed by tracking sea ice on a high-resolution grid. \n- The original synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.\n\n### Wetlands MEaSUREs\nThese products from the NASA Inundated Wetlands MEaSUREs project facilitate investigations on the role of wetlands in climate, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and biodiversity.\n\nThe inundated wetlands Earth System Data Records consists of two primary components:\n\n1. Fine-resolution maps of wetland extent, vegetation type, and seasonal inundation dynamics, derived from SAR for regional and continental-scale areas covering crucial wetlands systems. These are created using data from a variety of spaceborne SARs. The wetlands datasets were generated using algorithms appropriate to the nature of the wetlands systems under study, including time series and statistically-based tree classifiers.\n2. Global, coarse-resolution time series mappings of inundated area fraction at 25 km resolution derived from multiple satellite remote sensing observations including passive and active microwave sensors and optical data sets optimized for inundation detection. The algorithm employed in the generation of this dataset employs a clustering model and a mixture model in the classification of fractional inundated areas. These datasets are provided on a bi-monthly basis for 1992-1999 and daily for 2000 onward. Annual summary products, including maximum inundated extent and annual inundation duration, are provided. A daily near real time (NRT) dataset with 2-3 day latency is also provided.\n\n#### Data Products\n- Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS)\n- North America JERS-1 Mosaics\n- Alaska Wetlands Map derived from ALOS PALSAR fine beam data\n- Alaska Wetlands Map derived from JERS-1 SAR\n- Amazon Low and High Flood Backscatter Mosaics from JERS-1 SAR\n- Time-series Amazon Wetlands Extent Maps derived from PALSAR ScanSAR data\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [What is SAR?](https://asf.alaska.edu/information/sar-information/what-is-sar/#sar_faq)\n- [Video Introduction to SAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfn7P395O40)\n- [Video Overview of ASF's SAR Datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZzLg38cC8I)\n- [Data Recipe Library](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-basics/data-recipe-tutorials-2/)\n- [Data Recipes for ASF SAR Datasets in GIS Applications](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-basics/sar-data-and-gis/)\n- [Dataset Formats and Files](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-basics/asf-datasets-formats-and-files/)\n- [Product Types and Processing Levels](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-basics/types-of-synthetic-aperture-radar-sar-products/)\n- [Derived Datasets Overview](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/vertex/derived_datasets/)\n",

Please use 'intersectsWith' instead.\n\t- Bounding boxes define an area using two long/lat points. The Bounding box parameters are 4 comma-separated numbers: lower left longitude,latitude, and upper right longitude,latitude. This is a great choice for very wide search areas.\n\t- Example:\n\t\t- bbox=-150.2,65.0,-150.1,65.5\n\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">intersectsWith</span>\n\t- This keyword is also available through [asf_search](/asf_search/searching/#searching).\n\t- Search by polygon, a line segment (“linestring”), or a point defined in 2-D Well-Known Text (WKT). Each polygon must be explicitly closed, i.e. the first vertex and the last vertex of each listed polygon must be identical. Coordinate pairs for each vertex are in decimal degrees: longitude is followed by latitude.\n\t- Notes:\n\t\t- Does not support multi-polygon, multi-line or multi-point.\n \t\t- Polygon holes are ignored\n \t\t- This keyword also accepts a [POST request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP))\n \t- Example (*Note: The spaces and parentheses below need to be URL encoded first*):\n \t\t- intersectsWith=polygon((-119.543 37.925, -118.443 37.7421, -118.682 36.8525, -119.77 37.0352, -119.543 37.925 ))\n\t\t- intersectsWith=linestring(-119.543 37.925, -118.443 37.7421)\n\t\t- intersectsWith=point(-119.543, 37.925)\n\t- Properly URL encoded:\n\t\t- intersectsWith=point%28-119.543+37.925%29\n\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">polygon</span>\n\t- *Deprecation Notice:* This keyword will be deprecated. Please use 'intersectsWith' instead.\n\t- Bounding polygon in the digital long/lat format; enter coordinates in counter clockwise direction, repeat the first point at the end to close the polygon: in the format ABCDA\n\t- Example:\n\t\t- polygon=-155.08,65.82,-153.5,61.91,-149.50,63.07,-149.94,64.55,-153.28,64.47,-155.08,65.82\n\n#### Shape Validation\nIf the AOI specified is its own Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) in a mercator projection, the search results returned will instersect with the AOI in a mercator projection, regardless of width. This remains the case even if the international dateline is crossed within the AOI.\n\nIn order for an AOI to be considered its own MBR, it must meet the following criteria:\n\n  - Each vertex shares a latitude or longitude with its neighbors\n  - East/West points share longitude\n  - North/South points share latitude\n\nAOIs that do not fit this criteria will have their points connected along [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle).\n\nIn addition, all AOIs are validated, and then simplified as needed. The process for this is:\n \n  1. Validate the input AOI. If it is not valid, an error is displayed.\n  2. Merge overlapping shapes.\n  3. Convex hull.\n  4. Any out-of-range index values are handled by clamping and wrapping them to the valid range of values.\n  5. Simplify points based on proximity threshold. The target is fewer than 400 points.\n\nEach of these steps is performed only when necessary to get the AOI to a single outline with fewer than 400 points. Any unnecessary steps are skipped.\n\n**Examples of validation and simplification:**\n\n- A self-intersecting polygon is provided: \n\t- An error is displayed.\n- A single outline is provided, consisting of 1000 points:\n\t- A simplified version of the same outline is used, consisting of fewer than 400 points.\n- Multiple geometries are provided, all of them overlapping at least in part:\n\t- A single outline is returned, representing the outline of all the shapes combined.\n- Multiple geometries are provided, at least some of them entirely non-overlapping:\n\t- A single outline is returned, representing the convex hull of all the shapes together.\n\n\n### Temporal Parameters\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">processingDate</span>\n\t- This keyword is also available through [asf_search](/asf_search/searching/#searching).\n\t- Limit results to records that have been processed at ASF since a given date and/or time.\n\t- Example:\n\t\t- processingDate=2017-01-01T00:00:00UTC\n\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">start</span>\n\t- This keyword is also available through [asf_search](/asf_search/searching/#searching).\n\t- Date of data acquisition.

  "OVERVIEW_1": "## Overview\n\nRadar remote sensing has become a highly important data source in the Geosciences. This is mostly due to the ability of radar to penetrate clouds and operate independently of solar illumination. In addition radar sensors benefit from their ability to easily identify changes, track surface deformation with cm-accuracy, and map large areas regularly and over long time scales. It is not surprising that radar remote sensing is regularly used for studying earthquakes, volcanoes, and glaciers, as well as for the monitoring of anthropogenic activities such as hydrocarbon extraction, and groundwater pumping.\n\nWithin the SARVIEWS project, we are working on harnessing the capabilities of SAR by developing a fully automatic processing system that produces value-added products in support of monitoring natural disasters. The SARVIEWS processor is implemented in the Amazon Cloud and utilizes modern processing technology to generate geocoded and fully terrain corrected image time series, as well as interferometric SAR data over areas affected by natural disasters. To facilitate full automation, the SARVIEWS processing flow is triggered automatically by existing hazard alert systems such as the [USGS Earthquake Notification Service](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/). Currently, SARVIEWS is supporting hazards related to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The inclusion of flood events is in preparation.\n\n## Hazard Monitoring Criteria\n\nSARVIEWS subscriptions are created in near real-time based upon reports from monitoring organizations such as the USGS and the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program. Subscriptions are created automatically after checking [Earthquake Notification Service (ENS)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/) emails and [Volcano Notification Service (VNS)](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vns2/) emails, or the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program's weekly updates for active volcanoes outside the United States.\n\n### Earthquakes\n\nEarthquake subscriptions are created if the earthquake event has potential surface deformation, which is roughly assesed based upon the following logic:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Magnitude</th>\n      <th>Shallow: 0-35 km</th>\n      <th>Medium: 35-100 km</th>\n      <th>Deep: 100+ km</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Large: Mag 7.5+</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Medium: Mag 7.0 - 7.5</td>\n      <td>If within 75 km of coast</td>\n      <td>If within 25 km of coast</td>\n      <td>No</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Small: Mag 6.0 - 7.0</td>\n      <td>If within 25 km of coast</td>\n      <td>If within 0.5 km of coast</td>\n      <td>No</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThese criteria provide a quick estimate of the strength of the earthquake in relation to depth and the distance from land in order to limit event subscriptions to only those with the potential for surface deformation. This simple logic is created upon the ENS email, and does not wait for more data to calculate surface deformation with conventional seismologic methods. Once created, earthquake subscriptions process Sentinel data for 6 months from the date of the earthquake.\n\n### Volcanoes\n\nCriteria for volcano subscriptions reply on the VNS Activity Notice emails for domestic volcanoes, and the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program's RSS feed for international volcanoes. If a volcano is flagged as a WARNING Alert level, or a RED aviation code, a subscription is created for the volcano. Globally, if the volcano's activity is high enough to be triggered and posted by the Global Volcanism Program, SARVIEWS creates a subscription. Volcano subscriptions process data starting 1 year prior to the activity, and continue indefinitely until volcano activity levels return to normal.\n\n## On Demand Processing\n\nThe SARVIEWS processor takes full advantage of the extensive SAR archives available at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for Synthetic Aperture Radar data. Through ASF, SARVIEWS has efficient access to the historic and future acquisitions of the Sentinel-1 sensors, a spaceborne SAR system launched and operated by the European Space Agency. Sentinel-1 images all of Earth’s landmasses every 6 - 12 days, providing valuable data for hazard monitoring.\n\nTo efficiently access and process the incoming stream of Sentinel-1 SAR data, SARVIEWS leverages ASF HyP3, a cloud-based processing system that generates value-added SAR products on demand. On demand processing via HyP3 is also available from [ASF's Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?topic=onDemand). Through HyP3, SARVIEWS has full access to the benefits of the cloud, such as elastic scaling of compute resources and efficient cloud-based storage and distribution. For more information, please visit the [HyP3 Documentation](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/).\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is SARVIEWS free?**\n\nAll of the SARVIEWS products available in Vertex are freely available for download and use without restrictions. These are value-added products created from freely available Sentinel-1 data, with no login necessary. Please credit both ESA and SARVIEWS when using our data.\n\n**How do I bulk download products?**\n\nWhen you choose to copy the URLs for any event products, you will get a list of links to all of the selected SARVIEWS products. You may paste these links into a file, such as a .csv. To download the products, use a program such as wget with the '-i' option. For example:\n\n    ## move to the location you want the products to be downloaded\n    cd path/to/destination\n\n    ## download with the -i option to specify the .csv\n    wget -i path/to/download_all.csv\n\nYou may also download and run the Python Bulk Download script to download your selected event products.\n\n**When will the next product become available?**\n\nSARVIEWS automatically creates and archives products as soon as they become available. If a product is missing for a subscrciption, it means that the subscription is waiting on a new scene to be acquired, or it's still processing. Generally, there are 12 days between most Sentinel overpasses.\n\n**What software is used to process SARVIEWS data?**\n\nSARVIEWS events are processed using [GAMMA Remote Sensing](https://www.gamma-rs.ch/software) software tools through the ASF HyP3 engine. For more information on algoritm specifics, please visit the [ASF HyP3 products page](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/products/).\n\n## Acknowledgements & Contact\n\nThe SARVIEWS effort was funded by the [NASA Applied Sciences Disasters Program](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/disasters) through grant NNX12AQ38G. Sentinel-1 data is provided by the European Space Agency through their [Copernicus](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus) program.

  "SBAS_1": "# SBAS Search Type\n\n## What is SBAS?\nSBAS is an acronym for **short baseline subsets**. It is a technique used in interferometry. The Vertex SBAS tool provides perpendicular and temporal baseline data, as well as scene pairs, for a chosen reference scene.\n\n## What are some uses for SBAS?\nSBAS is widely used in the geosciences community. It works best for natural environments over a large scale and can be used to look at gradual change over time. SBAS requires input of a series of interferograms and the final output is a time series showing motion.\n\nOne advantage of SBAS is that you are not restricted to a single interferogram. You can see gradual changes over time. It can also be useful for older datasets which sometimes have irregular acquisitions. The temporal and spatial filtering can help increase the accuracy for measuring deformation.\n\nYou must choose which interferograms to use, which can require some experimentation. The Vertex SBAS tool simplifies this by providing good visualization and making it easier for you to quickly determine which scenes to use.\n\nThere are other preferred approaches for urban environments, or higher resolution needs. However, regardless of your analysis needs, the SBAS tool is a useful overview tool and can also be used as a 2-D baseline plot. It gives a comprehensive, but rapid visualization of scenes.\n\nFurther reading on baseline, including descriptions of multiple approaches, can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271615002415). A case study comparison of PS and SBAS can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5692806).\n\n## How to use Vertex SBAS Tool\nVisit **[ASF's Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu)** to begin using the SBAS tool.\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bQPdtuobdcg)\n\n### **Beginning your SBAS Search**\n\n- If you do not have a particular reference scene chosen, you can search for scenes using the geographic or list search. The center column will have a button under the metadata titled ***SBAS Tool*** for any scenes that are eligible. You may click this button to be directed to an SBAS search. The SBAS search will use the chosen scene as the reference scene.\n\n- If you do have a particular reference scene chosen, you can select ***SBAS*** from the Search Type dropdown list. You may enter your reference scene and hit ***Search***.\n\n### **Interacting with SBAS Search Results**\nWhile in SBAS Search type, you will notice many familiar controls in the results panel. The pairs are shown in the left column. The center column lists the metadata for the two endpoints of the selected pair. The SBAS Chart is shown in the right column.\n\n**Result Panel Controls**\n\n- At the top left of the results panel, you will see the number of pairs listed.\n- **Zoom** will *Zoom to results* magnifying the map area of the Earth where the scenes are located.\n- **Queue** will *Add all to Downloads* allowing you to add all scenes to the download queue.\n- **On Demand** will allow you to *Add all to On Demand queue* to perform custom processing on the scenes. You may also choose to *Create Subscription*.\n\t- You may choose from **RTC GAMMA**, **InSAR GAMMA**, or **autoRIFT**, depending on your needs. RTC GAMMA processing is performed on the individual scenes in your result set. InSAR GAMMA and autoRIFT processing are performed on the pairs in your result set.\n\t- **Note:** Currently, only scenes with beam mode IW are eligible for On Demand processing.\n- **Pairs** will *Download Pair CSV* which lists the scenes in each pair and the download URL for each. It also includes the baseline values.\n- In the left column, highlight the desired pair and click the **On Demand** icon to *Add pair to On Demand queue*. You may choose *InSAR GAMMA* or *autoRIFT* processing for each pair you wish to add.\n\n**Chart Controls**\n\n- The dots on the chart represent individual scenes. Hovering over them will list their temporal and perpendicular information. The lines represent the pairs.\n- You may use the mouse to navigate the chart. There are **Zoom In** and **Zoom Out** buttons located above the chart. The **Zoom to Fit** button will fit all of the pairs into the visible chart.\n- You may click on any pair line in the chart. When you do, the selected pair is highlighted in red and the metadata for that pair is shown in the center column.\n- You may adjust the temporal and perpendicular baseline using the sliders on the chart.\n- You may also create your own pair if desired:\n\t1. Under **Custom Pair**, click the **Plus symbol** to *Start adding custom pair*.\n\t7. Click the dot on the chart representing the first scene.\n\t2. Click the dot on the chart representing the second scene.\n\t3. The new pair is created, and the pair detail is added to the bottom of the result list. Manually added pairs will be displayed with a dotted line on the chart.\n\t4. **Note:** You may also add custom pairs to the On Demand queue.\n- If you wish to stop adding a pair after you have begun, you may click the **Square symbol** to *Stop adding custom pair*.\n- If you wish to delete an added pair, you may click on the dotted pair line and click the **Minus symbol** to *Remove custom pair*. Note that only manually added pairs may be deleted.\n\n#### Gaps Detected Warning Message\n\nIf there are gaps detected in your SBAS pairs, a warning message will be displayed. It is recommended to avoid disconnected InSAR pair networks. Disconnected pair networks make it difficult to create unbiased estimates of InSAR velocities within a time-series analysis. \n\nIf you wish to eliminate the gaps, you may modify your search filters, such as increasing the temporal baseline until all scenes are connected. You may also add manual pairs for the missing connections. Once all scenes have at least one connection, the warning message will disappear. \n\n#### SBAS Criteria\n\n- Click **SBAS Criteria...** for additional filtering options.\n\t- You may enter a **Start** or **End** date, or select dates on the calendar.\n\t- **Seasonal Search** allows constraining the results to certain annual periods within an overall range of dates.  Click the Seasonal Search toggle and additional options will appear, allowing you to adjust the sliders to specify a seasonal range (*Season Start Day/Season End Day*).\n\t- **Latitudinal Overlap** allows you to set the overlap threshold for pairs. Filtering out non-overlapping pairs can reduce errors in On Demand InSAR processing.\n\t\t- **No Overlap Threshold** is the default. All pair results are returned, including any non-overlapping pairs.\n\t\t- **Any Overlap Threshold** will ensure that all pairs have some overlap. Any non-overlapping pairs will be filtered out of the results.\n\t\t- **50% Overlap Threshold** ensures that all pairs have approximately 50% overlap. Any pairs with less overlap will be filtered out of the results.\n\n## Next Steps\nThe next step is creating interferograms. You may do this through On Demand processing in Vertex. First, you would add some or all of the pairs to the On Demand queue as InSAR jobs. In the queue, there are limited options available for customizing your InSAR processing. You may also specify a project name. Submit the queue when you have selected all desired options. When the interferograms are completed, you can view and download them by using the On Demand Products search type in Vertex.\n\nFor areas with glacial ice, autoRIFT is another processing option. Similar to InSAR, you would add some or all pairs to the On Demand queue as autoRIFT jobs. There are no additional customization options available for autoRIFT processing, however you can still specify a project name. When autoRIFT processing is completed, you can view and download the products by using the On Demand Products search type in Vertex.\n\nMore detail can be found in the [Vertex User Guide](/vertex/manual). Help documentation, including videos, is also available in Vertex [here](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?maxResults=250&topic=onDemand).\n\nTo learn more, you may also see the [On Demand documentation](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/).\n",

Each polygon must be explicitly closed, i.e. the first vertex and the last vertex of each listed polygon must be identical. Coordinate pairs for each vertex are in decimal degrees: longitude is followed by latitude.\n    - Example:\n        - intersectsWith='POLYGON((-152.81 58.49,-154.90 57.49,-155.08 56.30,-153.82 56.34,-151.99 57.30,-151.43 58.19,-152.81 58.49))'\n        - intersectsWith='LINESTRING(-119.543 37.925, -118.443 37.7421)'\n        - intersectsWith='POINT(-119.543 37.925)'\n\n#### Shape Validation\nIf the AOI specified is its own Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) in a mercator projection, the search results returned will instersect with the AOI in a mercator projection, regardless of width. This remains the case even if the international dateline is crossed within the AOI.\n\nIn order for an AOI to be considered its own MBR, it must meet the following criteria:\n\n  - Each vertex shares a latitude or longitude with its neighbors\n  - East/West points share longitude\n  - North/South points share latitude\n\nAOIs that do not fit this criteria will have their points connected along [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle).\n\nIn addition, all AOIs are validated, and then simplified as needed. The process for this is:\n \n  1. Validate the input AOI. If it is not valid, an error is displayed.\n  2. Merge overlapping shapes.\n  3. Convex hull.\n  4. Any out-of-range index values are handled by clamping and wrapping them to the valid range of values.\n  5. Simplify points based on proximity threshold. The target is fewer than 400 points.\n\nEach of these steps is performed only when necessary to get the AOI to a single outline with fewer than 400 points. Any unnecessary steps are skipped.\n\n**Examples of validation and simplification:**\n\n- A self-intersecting polygon is provided: \n    - An error is displayed.\n- A single outline is provided, consisting of 1000 points:\n    - A simplified version of the same outline is used, consisting of fewer than 400 points.\n- Multiple geometries are provided, all of them overlapping at least in part:\n    - A single outline is returned, representing the outline of all the shapes combined.\n- Multiple geometries are provided, at least some of them entirely non-overlapping:\n    - A single outline is returned, representing the convex hull of all the shapes together.\n\n### Temporal Parameters\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">processingDate</span>\n    - Limit results to records that have been processed at ASF since a given date and/or time.\n    - Example:\n        - processingDate='2017-01-01T00:00:00UTC'\n\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">start</span>\n    - Date of data acquisition.

This keyword may be used in conjunction with start/end to specify a seasonal range within an overall date range. Values are based on the Julian calendar. You must specify both a season start and end date.\n    - Example:\n        - season=[1, 31]\n        - season=[45, 67]\n        - season=[360, 10]\n    - Values:\n        - 1 through 365\n\n### Baseline Parameters\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">stack_from_id</span>\n    - Input the scene name for which you wish to see baseline results.\n    - stack_from_id may not be used in conjuction with other keywords.\n    - Example: \n        - stack_from_id('S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20220215T225119_20220215T225146_041930_04FE2E_9252-SLC')\n    - See the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-asf_search/blob/master/examples/4-Baseline_Search.ipynb) for usage examples, as well as best practices.\n\n### Results Parameters\n- <span style=\"color: #236192; font-size: 20px;\">maxResults</span>\n    - Maximum number of data records to return.\n    - Example:\n        - maxResults=10\n",
  "TOOLS_1": "# Search API Tools\n\nSearches may be executed in a variety of ways, depending on your needs. On this page, you will find syntax & character encoding tips, and further information on some of the ways to run Search API queries.\n\n## Syntax and Character Encoding\n\n**Syntax tips**\n\n1. A \"?\" separates the endpoint URL from the keywords.\n2. Keywords are joined by a \"&\". Some operating systems or programs may require a \"\\&\"\n3. There may not be any spaces or parentheses in the URL string. See below for how to encode these characters.\n\n**Character Encoding:**\n\n>space\n>\n>replace with '%20'. Use '+'  in keyword values\n>\n>(\n>\n>replace with '%28'\n>\n>)\n>\n>replace with '%29'\n>\n\nFor a complete list of URL codes, please see [URL Encoding Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp).\n\n**Escaping Characters**\n\nIf you are running Search API queries via command line, you may need to escape characters. Escaping a character tells the command line interface to interpret the character literally. Some characters that need to be escaped include spaces and ampersands (&).\n\nFor more information on escaping characters, please see the [Bash Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/escapingsection.html). For Windows users, more information can be found [here](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-esc.html).\n\n## Program Details\n\nYou may use a program to assist you with Search API queries. This section will provide some details on a few of the programs you can use to write & run Search API queries and some example commands for each.\n\n- [aria2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/aria2)\n- [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)\n- [cURL](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html)\n\nBoth [Wget](http://wget.addictivecode.org/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.html?action=show&redirect=Faq#download) and [cURL](https://curl.se/) are often installed on Linux systems. cURL is part of the Mac OS, and Wget can be installed. Microsoft Windows OS does not come with either installed, but both can be downloaded. cURL is easier to set up on a Windows machine.

  "TROUBLESHOOTING_1": "# Search API Troubleshooting\n\nIf you are troubleshooting Search API queries, consider using asf_search. asf_search is a Python package for performing searches of the ASF catalog. More information can be found [here](/asf_search/basics).\n\n**Trouble Area: Query returns HTTP 429 with error message**\n\n- Reason: Query returns HTTP 429 with error message \"Rate limited, please reduce your request rate to 250/minute or less\"\n- Remedy: There is a rate limitation on the search endpoint. Refer to [Rate limitations](/api/cookbook/#rate-limitation-on-search-endpoint) for tips on how to construct your queries. \n\n**Trouble Area: Windows cURL “unrecognized protocol”**\n\n- Reason: Invisible double quotes inserted when copy/pasting examples\n- Remedy: Delete the visible quotes, which will delete the invisible quotes. Then retype quotes.\n\n**Trouble Area: Download fails with “401 Unauthorized” or “Authorization failed”**\n\n- Reason: Missing or invalid Earthdata username/password\n- Remedy: Check that you are correctly including your Earthdata username and password in your download command or config file.\n\n**Trouble Area: Download fails with “401 Unauthorized” or “Authorization failed”**\n\n- Reason: Special characters in Earthdata password\n- Remedy: Passwords with special characters will need to be inside quotes.\n\n**Trouble Area: Can’t authenticate**\n\n- Reason: Missing study area or EULA\n- Remedy: Log in to Earthdata and ensure your study area is set, and you have agreed to all necessary End-User License Agreements.\n\n**Trouble Area: Search API request with ‘+’ in it fails**\n\n- Reason: Some keyword values could contain spaces.\n- Remedy: Try replacing the ‘+’ with ‘%2B’. For further details, refer to Character Encoding on the [Tools page](/api/tools).\n\n**Trouble Area: Search API request fails**\n\n- Reason: https is required\n- Remedy: Make sure you are using https, not http.\n\n**Trouble Area: Search API request hangs, fails, or returns an error**\n\n- Reason: Your URL may include spaces or special characters.\n- Remedy: Refer to Character Encoding on the [Tools page](/api/tools) and ensure you are encoding spaces and special characters correctly.\n\n**Trouble Area: Search API returns Validation Error**\n\n- Reason: The reason for the validation error is included in the returned error message.\n- Remedy: Refine your keywords and values as needed. If you are unsure why you received the validation error, you may contact ASF using the info below.\n\n**Trouble Area: Search API query does not return expected number of results**\n\n- Reason: There is a 15 minute time limit on running Search API queries.\n- Remedy: First, try the same query with \"output=count\". If the count is high, consider narrowing your search by using more keywords, or by using keyword “maxResults” to limit it. You may also try shortening the date range to split your search into a series of smaller searches.\n\n**Trouble Area: Search API query with \"product_list\" keyword returns no results**\n\n- Reason: Other keywords may be competing with the product_list value(s).\n- Remedy: Try removing other keywords from your query. You may also try \"output=count\" to see how many results your query should return.\n\n**Trouble Area: Selected output format does not include needed fields**\n\n- Reason: Some output formats include different fields.\n- Remedy: GeoJSON is the preferred default format. If a required field is not included, please contact ASF using the info below or reach the team directly at <uaf-asf-discovery@alaska.edu>\n\n<!-- - Trouble Area: Certificate rejected\n\t- Reason: Third-party certificates out of date, a problem for https searches\n\t- Remedy: Use http OR disable certificate checks.\n\t\t- [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) –insecure\n\t\t- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) –no-check-certificate\n -->\n",
  "VERTEX_MANUAL_1": "# Vertex Getting Started User Guide\n\n- If you do not already have one, create a free **[Earthdata Login account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new)**.\n- Go to **[Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu)**\n\t- Log in by clicking the **Sign in** icon in the top right of the window. Use your Earthdata Login username and password.\n\t![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_Db_ipKLos)\n- Search Type allows you to choose between all available search types.\n\n## Language Options\n\nIn the top right menu, next to the **Sign In** icon, there are language control options. Vertex currently offers English and Spanish. If your browser is set to one of the available languages, Vertex will default to that language. You may click the button and select your desired language from the drop down list. You may also set a default language in your **Preferences**. \n\n## *Geographic* Search Options\n\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/JovQ-rG9ZJE)\n\n- In the top left corner of the map, there are buttons that allow you to change your **map projection**, **zoom**, and **map view**.\n\t- By default, the map is in equatorial projection. You may click **Map View** and select **Arctic map view** or **Antarctic map view** to change your map projection. Click **Equatorial map view** to switch back to the equatorial projection.\n\t- You may click the **Zoom In** or **Zoom Out** icons to adjust your zoom.\n\t- The default map layer is satellite. You may click the **Layers** button and select **Satellite View** or **Street View** to switch your map layer.\n\t\t- You may click **Overview Map** to add an overview map in the top right corner of the map. Click it again to turn off the overview map.\n\t\t- You may click **Gridlines** to add a graticule overlay to the map. Click it again to turn off the overlay. *Note*: This is currently only available in the equatorial map view.\n\t- You may click **Opacity** and adjust the slider as desired to change the opacity of browse images displayed on the map.\n- Navigate to your area of interest by dragging the map while holding down the left mouse button.\n- By default, the map-drawing tool is a bounding box. Click on the map once to specify the starting corner, move the mouse, then click again to finish the box. Additional drawing tool options are available in the toolbar at the top of the screen, including *point*, *linestring*, and *polygon* options.\n\t- **Point** allows you to define an area of interest by clicking on the map to place a point.\n\t- **Line** allows you to define an area of interest over a series of line segments by clicking on the map multiple times. Double-click to stop adding segments.\n\t- **Polygon** allows you to define an area of interest over an arbitrary polygon. You will receive an error message at the bottom of the window if there was a problem with the polygon (self-intersecting, reversed polygon winding order, etc.).\n\t- **Box** allows you to define an area of interest over a lat/long-aligned bounding box by clicking once to set one corner, and again to set the opposite corner.\n\t- Once a shape has been drawn, select the **Edit current area of interest** icon on the toolbar to move, add, and delete points. Select the **Draw new area of interest** icon to create a new AOI.\n\t- Clicking **Upload Goespatial File** brings up the Area of Interest dialog window. You may enter a WKT string, upload a geospatial file, or enter a location.\n- **Dataset** enables you to choose the dataset of interest.\n\t- If you need more information about a particular dataset, click on the appropriate question mark icon in the Dataset selector.\n- **Filters...** enables you to further refine your search\n\n### Area of Interest Options\n\n- **Area of Interest** gives you the option of entering a set of geographic coordinates, importing an area of interest as a geospatial file, or searching for a location. Click on the down arrow next to **Area of Interest** in the top menu.\n\t- An area of interest may be defined by a set of coordinates entered in the **Area of Interest WKT** window.\n\t\t- Coordinates should be entered as decimal degrees in *well-known text* (WKT) format. Coordinates entered as a comma-separated long/lat string (e.g. -97.38,36.46,-53.44,36.46...) will be automatically converted by Vertex to WKT format.\n\t- To upload a geospatial file, click **Select Files** and navigate to a folder on your computer, or drag and drop files into the box. *GeoJSON*, *shapefiles*, and *KML* files are supported provided they are in a latitude/longitude-based coordinate system, such as WGS84.\n\t\t- When importing a *GeoJSON* file, all geometries in the file will be included. If multiple geometries are found, a convex hull will be used to represent them in the search.\n\t\t- *Shapefiles* can be either a single *.shp* file, multiple shapefile components (*.shp, .shx, .dbf*), or a *zip* file containing one or more shapefile components. At a minimum, the *.shp* component must be included in all cases.\n\t- To enter a location, click the **Search for a Location** field, and start typing the name of the location. Select your desired location from the drop down list. \n\t\t- Once you have selected a location, it will be geocoded into WKT format coordinates.\n\t- You can save the coordinates of a search so they can be used to exactly recreate an area of interest in later searches.\n\t\t- Once the **Area of Interest** has been set, a *Copy to clipboard* icon will appear. Click on the icon and paste the coordinates into a new search or to a text file for later use.\n\t\t- Note: See the section **Other Vertex Options** for additional ways of saving searches.\n\t- At any time you can clear your search area by clicking on the **Clear** button.\n\n#### Shape Validation\nIf the AOI specified is its own Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) in a mercator projection, the search results returned will instersect with the AOI in a mercator projection, regardless of width. This remains the case even if the international dateline is crossed within the AOI.\n\nIn order for an AOI to be considered its own MBR, it must meet the following criteria:\n\n  - Each vertex shares a latitude or longitude with its neighbors\n  - East/West points share longitude\n  - North/South points share latitude\n\nAOIs that do not fit this criteria will have their points connected along [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle).\n\nIn addition, all AOIs are validated, and then simplified as needed. The process for this is:\n\n  1. Validate the input AOI. If it is not valid, an error is displayed.\n  2. Merge overlapping shapes.\n  3. Convex hull.\n  4. Any out-of-range index values are handled by clamping and wrapping them to the valid range of values.\n  5. Simplify points based on proximity threshold. The target is fewer than 400 points.\n\nEach of these steps is performed only when necessary to get the AOI to a single outline with fewer than 400 points. Any unnecessary steps are skipped.\n\n**Examples of validation and simplification:**\n\n- A self-intersecting polygon is provided:\n\t- An error is displayed.\n- A single outline is provided, consisting of 1000 points:\n\t- A simplified version of the same outline is used, consisting of fewer than 400 points.\n- Multiple geometries are provided, all of them overlapping at least in part:\n\t- A single outline is returned, representing the outline of all the shapes combined.\n- Multiple geometries are provided, at least some of them entirely non-overlapping:\n\t- A single outline is returned, representing the convex hull of all the shapes together.\n\n### Date Filters\n\n- **Date Filters** Search dates are optional, so they default to empty.  If you are searching for specific dates, you can define the date range further in the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields. The date picker will automatically constrain your selection to a valid range for the selected dataset.\n\t- *Note*: this information may also be found by clicking on the question mark icon for a dataset.\n\t- **Seasonal Search** allows constraining the search to certain annual periods within an overall range of dates.  Click the Seasonal Search toggle and additional options will appear, allowing you to enter an overall date range (*Start Date/End Date*) and the seasonal range (*Season Start Day/Season End Day*).\n\n### Additional Filters\n\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vd9eDL9KVK4)\n\n- **Additional Filters** allow for additional parameters to be applied to narrow your search and reduce the number of results. Not all filters will be available for all datasets.\n\t- **File Type** – Limit the search to specific types of files. Multiple selections allowed.\n\t- **Beam Mode** – Limit the search to specific beam modes. Multiple selections allowed.\n\t- **Polarization** – Limit the search to specific polarizations. Multiple selections allowed.\n\t- **Direction** – Limit the search to a specific orbit direction.\n\t- **Subtype** – Limit the search to a specific mission spacecraft.\n\t- **Group ID** – Limit the search to a specific group ID.\n\t- **Burst ID** – Limit the search to a specific burst ID. Multiple burst IDs allowed.\n\t- **Standard Products or CalVal Products** – Limit the search to either CalVal or Standard products. May choose one option. This selector is only available for the Opera-S1 dataset.\n\n\n### Path and Frame Filters\n\n- **Path and Frame Filters** are available for select datasets. You may enter a single path or frame, or a range. Due to inconsistent Sentinel-1 framing, we recommend searching for a frame of interest by ±1-2 frames.\n- The maximum number of results is displayed below the **SEARCH** button. Click the **down arrow** to choose your preferred maximum results.\n\t- You may click **API URL...** in order to generate the API URL matching your current search parameters. This will open a new window.\n\t\t- **Amount** allows you to set the maximum results.\n\t\t- **Format** allows you to choose your preferred output format.\n\t\t- The **Copy** icon next to the URL will copy the URL. It can be pasted into a browser search bar to perform the API search, or pasted into a document and saved.\n\t\t- **API Docs** will send you to the [API Documentation](https://asf.alaska.edu/api/).\n\t\t- **Download Results** will download the results in the specified output format.\n- Once all parameters have been chosen, click **SEARCH**. Search results will appear in the footer area of the Vertex window, and on the map.\n\t- *Note*: The number of files that are predicted to match the current search parameters is displayed under the SEARCH button. If there are no predicted matches, the search button will be greyed out and display NO RESULTS.\n\n## *List* Search Options\n\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/oetqxZkqVZM)\n\n- Selecting **List Search** opens the *List Search* window and allows you to enter a list of scenes or file names.\n\t- **Scene** allows searching for specific scene names (granule names), and the results will include any files that are part of those scenes.\n\t- **File** allows searching for specific file names (product names), and the results will only include exactly those files.\n- **Edit List** opens the *List Search* window so you can make changes to your list\n- Once all parameters have been chosen, click **SEARCH**. Search results will appear in the footer area of your browser window, and on the map.\n\t- *Note*: The number of files that are predicted to match the current search parameters is displayed under the SEARCH button. If there are no predicted matches, the search button will be greyed out and will display NO RESULTS.\n\n### List Search File Import\nYou may **drag and drop files** into the box provided on the **Scene** or **File** tabs. Each tab lists the file types accepted at the bottom. Vertex will parse the scene or file names from your uploaded file.\n\n- *Note*: Each file type requires a specific format. Files exported from Vertex will have the correct format.\n\n- **CSV** requires a column labeled \"Granule Name\" for a scene list search. It requires an additonal \"Processing Level\" column for a file list search.\n- **GeoJSON** requires a field labeled \"granuleName\" for scene list search. It requires a field labeled \"fileID\" for file list search.\n- **Metalink** requires a structure formatted as\n```\n<metalink>\n    <files>\n        <file name=\"[Scene-Name.zip]\"></file>\n        <file name =\"...\n        ...</file>\n    </files>\n</metalink>\n```\n\n- **KML** requires a structure formatted as\n```\n<kml>\n    <Document>\n        <Placemark>\n            <name>[Scene Name]</name>\n        </Placemark>\n    </Document>\n</kml>\n```\n\n## *Baseline* Search Options\n\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp5bgvi2pEM)\n\n- Selecting **Baseline Search** provides a space to enter the name of a Reference Scene, and will then search for all secondary scenes that match the coverage area of the Reference.\n\t- *Note*: If there are no matching scenes, the RESULTS button will be greyed out and will display NO RESULTS.\n- Once a Reference Scene has been entered, click **SEARCH**. Search results will appear under the map. Clicking on the *Zoom to results* icon at the top of the left results column will display the location of the stack of scenes on the map.\n- The graph displays the Temporal and Perpendicular (spatial) relationship of the secondary scenes to the Reference.\n- Clicking on **Baseline Criteria...** above the graph will open the *Baseline Search* window. Using the sliders, the Temporal and Perpendicular extents can be adjusted to limit the number of secondary scenes displayed in the results.\n- For further information on **Baseline**, please see the [Baseline documentation](/vertex/baseline).\n\n## *SBAS* Search Options\n\n![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bQPdtuobdcg)\n\n- Selecting **SBAS Search** provides a space to enter the name of a Reference Scene, and will search for all secondary scenes that match the coverage area of the Reference. It is an alternate method used for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing, similar to Baseline.\n\t- *Note*: If there are no matching scenes, the RESULTS button will be greyed out and will display NO RESULTS.\n- Once a Reference Scene has been entered, click **SEARCH**. Search results will appear under the map. Clicking on the *Zoom to results* icon at the top of the left results column will display the location of the stack of scenes on the map.\n- The chart displays the Temporal and Perpendicular (spatial) relationship of the secondary scenes to the Reference.\n\t- **Zoom In** and **Zoom Out** buttons are available above the chart.\n\t- The **Zoom to Fit** button ensures that all pairs are visible on the chart.\n\t- The **Custom Pair** buttons allow you to add or delete a custom pair.\n\t- The **SBAS Criteria...** button allows you to specify additional criteria to refine your results, such as start and end dates, seasonal date settings, and latitudinal overlap threshold settings.\n- For further information on **SBAS**, please see the [SBAS documentation](/vertex/sbas).\n\n## *Event* Search Options\n\n- Selecting **Event** allows you to view and search the products created for hazard monitoring.\n- **Event Search** allows you to enter an event name. You may enter the full name or a partial string.\n- **Event Types** allows you to filter which types of events you wish to see. Currently, there are earthquake and volcano events.\n- **Start Date** and **End Date** allow you to specify a date range for events.\n- Additional options may be found under **Filters**.\n\t- You may toggle the **Active Events Only** switch to display only active events. The default is to display all events, including inactive events.\n\t- You may adjust the **Magnitude** slider to filter earthquakes by your desired magnitude range. *Note:* This filter applies only to earthquake events. If your search includes volcanoes, these will continue to be displayed in your search results.\n- For further information on **Event** search, please see the [Event Search documentation](/vertex/events).\n\n## *On Demand Products* Search Options\n\n- Selecting **On Demand Products** allows you to view your submitted On Demand jobs. *Note*: You must be signed in to access this.
